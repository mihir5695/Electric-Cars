# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis
Project Description:
This project involves analyzing the "Electric Vehicle Population Data" dataset. The dataset likely contains information about electric vehicles, and the analysis may cover aspects such as the distribution of vehicle makes, correlation between different features, and other relevant insights.

###Prerequisites:
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas library
NumPy library
Matplotlib library
Seaborn library
Installing:
Follow these steps to get the development environment running:Clone the repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/mihir5695/electric-vehicle-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory.
bash
Copy code
cd electric-vehicle-analysis
Install the required dependencies.
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
#Running the Tests:
To run the automated tests, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
pytest
End-to-End Tests:
These tests ensure that the entire analysis pipeline works as expected. For example, testing the loading of the dataset, data cleaning, and final visualization.

#Coding Style Tests:
These tests check if the code follows a specific style guide (e.g., PEP 8). For example, ensuring consistent indentation and variable naming.

#Deploy:
To deploy this analysis on a live system, consider the following steps:

Ensure that Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed on the target system.
Transfer the Jupyter Notebook file (your_analysis.ipynb) to the server or hosting environment.
If using additional datasets, ensure they are accessible to the deployed environment.
Execute the Jupyter Notebook on the server, making sure to run each cell in order.
Monitor any potential dependencies or library installations required for the analysis.
#Built With:

Python - The primary programming language for data analysis.
Jupyter Notebook - An interactive computing environment for working with Python.
Pandas - A powerful data manipulation library for Python.
Matplotlib - A comprehensive library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
Seaborn - A statistical data visualization library.
